# SentenceLDA: Discriminative and Robust Document Representation with Sentence Level Topic Model (EACL 2024)

We introduce the new sentence-level topic model, SentenceLDA.
We found out that the SentenceLDA returns more discriminative, robust and interpretable document representation.

## Installation
1. install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. install `choldate` with `pip install git+https://github.com/jcrudy/choldate.git`

## Run SentenceLDA
1. Put your corpus file on `/data` as a line-breaked `.txt` file. (See `/data/sample.txt`)
2. Run `train.py` with arguments `-d` (data path) and `-n` (the number of topics).
3. Run `generate.py` to check the topics in natural language form.
4. Check the `result.json`.
